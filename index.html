            <p>
                You might saw me as a lawyer moving cases, solving problems of others. But in this pendemic situation the world has taken a pause. Which gave me the space to rethink of my journey and goal. That's why I redefined my goal and started to learn web development to contribute in my society. I will not stop untill I become the web development hero.

                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                <p>
                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
